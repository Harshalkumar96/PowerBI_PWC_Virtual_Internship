## Task 3-Customer Retention-Customer demographics and insights.

### Problem Statement

The telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

• Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them.

• The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination.

• Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk.

• We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end.

• We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management.

Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

Define proper KPIs

Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs

### Here are some inputs:

• Customers who left within the last month

• Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

• Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical

• Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

### Suggestions

• Increasing the basic contract plan from 1 month to 3 months or 6 months can be a good starting point. This will help customers to be with us for a longer tenure.

• Starting special offers or schemes for customers who are single and have no family responsibility. They can become a permanent customer of the company. 'Catch them Young' is key to success here.

• provide some offers to the senior citizens as they are stable customers like overall offer some discounts on long tenure plans.

• Offering basic services like device protection, tech support, and online security should be the primary goal. This will help the customer stay longer with the brand.
